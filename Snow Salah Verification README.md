There is a phenomenon in football that occurs around every December-January - the winter period. 
The Liverpool and Egypt winger known as Mohamed Salah switches gears. The astonishing performances he puts in this particular period has led to the the moniker Snow Salah - a play on Mo Salah.
In this project I use data from the 2021-22 season to verify the truth behind this phenomenon. Further seasons will be added later.
I test the clinicality of his goal-scoring prowess across the entire season, with appearances in the winter ranging between around 25 to 40 or so. There is a marked increase in the best fit curve, and maybe there 
is some truth to the nickname in this season. However, upon adding more seasons, a true picture will begin to form more clearly.
